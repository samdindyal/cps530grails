      The framework performed to expectation. The fact that it was easy to install and configure was great.
      The quick and easy set-up for new projects, as well as the ability to configure the web page without restarting the server
      was incredibly convenient. Where Grails fell short, was only the fact that the server does take a while to load the code.

    <h3>Learning Curve</h3>
    <p>
      The learning curve compared to HTML/CSS was about the same, other than having to learn how to set up the Grails Server Pages.
      <br>
      There are no regrets in our choice of framework.
