    <h1>What is Grails?</h1>
    <p class = "text-content">
      Grails is a web framework for the Java platform, that is built on top of Spring Boot.
      With its initial release in 2005, then known as Groovy on Rails, Grails uses the Apache Groovy programming language.
      Grails follows the "Coding-by Convention" paradigm, a principle that focuses on the idea of reducing the number of decisions
      the programmer must make without losing flexibility.
